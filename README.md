# Electricity Bill Management System

## Project Description
This is a simple Python-based Electricity Bill Management System.  
It allows you to:
- Add new users with their CNIC and units consumed.
- Show all users and their bills.
- Search for a user by CNIC.
- Delete a user.
- Show total revenue collected.

The system calculates bills based on units consumed and ensures that each CNIC is unique.
